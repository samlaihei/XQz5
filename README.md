# XQz5
 Sample of the brightest quasars between 4.5 < z < 5.3. The reduced and flux-calibrated spectra are 
 made available in this repository, alongside XQz5_properties.fits, which is a file that contains
 the spectroscopic redshifts and measured MgII line properties of QSOs in the sample.
 
 For the spectral data fits files, there are only three columns:

- Wavelength: observed frame wavelength in units of angstroms
- Flux: observed frame flux in units of erg/s/cm2/angstrom
- eFlux: observed frame flux standard deviation error in the same units as the Flux column
